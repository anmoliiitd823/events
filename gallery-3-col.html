                        Sing. Sing together. Sing your hearts out.

Blow our minds with your melody. 
Take our breath away with your swells of harmony.
 Own the airwaves as you let your voices become one.

It is time to finally show what makes you a team.

Free yourself from the strings and the skins, 
you are the only instrument you need.
So come with your team, vocalize, harmonize, 
snap your fingers, tap your feet and show us the 
magic you can create together.


Acapellujah 18 is on!

We at IIIT Delhi would like to give artists a platform 
to fabricate music with the sounds generated only by 
the human body, be it vocalising, harmonising, tapping 
their feet, snapping their fingers or beat-boxing. 
Indian or western, language no bar, genre no bar. In A 
Cappella, the participants are members of an orchestra, 
in which they are the
  instrument, and they must use their voice and body in unison with those of others to stir the audience. There is 
  music inside each one of us; the challenge is to let it out for the world to applaud.

You want everyone to feel the music reach our soul. Bring out your riffs, shred off your solos, blast your rhythm and make the spectators ecstatic. The stage is all yours; now it’s on you to amaze Delhi with your performance and win the hearts of the people!

                        The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches, born to muggles, The Dark Lord would himself mark him/her as his equal, but the 'Chosen One' will have a power the Dark Lord knows not, either must die at the hands of the other for neither can live while the other survives.

The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will make himself known to the world as the month of January arrives..

This is a prophecy by the Divination Professor of IIIT-D. Those who claim to be the 'CHOSEN ONE' will have to encounter a series of hardships to weed out The Death Eaters and destroy all horcruxes, to mark an end to the dark and terrible times muggles and wizards alike face.

So come, test your destiny as we lead the surge against the dark forces to restore the lost peace of our world!


Do keep an eye out on this page where our Divination Professor will regularly be making prophecies!!

Mount your Cleansweeps. Zoom on your Firebolts. Its time for the greatest sport the wizarding world has ever seen: Quidditch played by muggles(nomags for the americans out there).
Get ready to feel the adrenaline as the quaffle soars through the rings, the rush as you dodge the bludger by an inch and the elation as you catch the snitch.
It doesn't matter if you are a beater, a seeker or to quote our favourite magizoologist "more of a chaser really", you have a place with us because Quidditch shall always be played at IIIT with those who ask for it.

                      At this year's edition of Odyssey - A Fantasy Saga, let us harbinger you to our debating event, which reintroduces itself through the extravaganza surrounding our much awaited cultural festival. Rather than unidirectionally extending your perspectives, we allow you to showcase your ability of making a surfaced argument from either side.

We at IIIT believe that the essence of debating prevails in the language and intellectual honesty of the debaters, alongside the engagement of the listeners, which is why we’ll declare an Open House after all the speakers conclude to let everyone around rejoice in the true spirit of our event.

poetry I feel like people are
so worried about the
performance that the words
might not be as strong”
~Amber Tamblyn
